              <h1 class="heading_style">Tigers and extinction</h1>
    <p>Extinct tiger subspecies represent a somber chapter in the history of wildlife conservation. Once roaming diverse landscapes from the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java to the vast expanses of Central Asia, these tigers were lost to the wild due to a combination of habitat destruction, poaching, and human encroachment. The Bali tiger, with its distinctive dark stripes, and the Javan tiger, adapted to the dense forests of Java, were both driven to extinction in the mid-20th century. Similarly, the Caspian tiger, which thrived across the Caspian region, disappeared by the 1970s. The loss of these subspecies underscores the urgent need for ongoing conservation efforts to protect the remaining tiger populations and preserve their habitats, ensuring that future generations can still marvel at these majestic creatures.</p>
   
    <h2 class="heading_style">Extinct Subspecies of Tigers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bali Tiger (Panthera tigris balica)
            The Bali tiger, the smallest of the tiger subspecies, once inhabited the Indonesian island of Bali. This subspecies was known for its distinctive darker stripes and smaller size compared to its relatives. By the 1950s, the Bali tiger was declared extinct due to habitat destruction and hunting. </li>
        <li>Javan Tiger (Panthera tigris sondaica)
            Native to the Indonesian island of Java, the Javan tiger was slightly larger than the Bali tiger but was similarly affected by habitat loss and hunting. Despite conservation efforts, this subspecies vanished from the wild in the 1970s. The last known Javan tiger was seen in 1976, and it remains a poignant symbol of the impact of human activity on wildlife.</li>    
        <li>Caspian Tiger (Panthera tigris virgata)
            Once found across the Caspian region, including parts of Turkey, Iran, and Central Asia, the Caspian tiger was a robust and resilient subspecies adapted to a diverse range of habitats. Unfortunately, relentless hunting and habitat encroachment led to its extinction in the 1970s. Today, the Caspian tiger is remembered for its unique adaptations and significant role in the ecosystem.</li>
        <li>Thylacine
            Also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, this marsupial became extinxt in 1936. Although not a real tiger its an honorable mention on this list due to its distinct tiger stripe pattern on its lower back.</li>

<h3 class="heading_style">China and Tiger Farms</h3>
    <p>In recent years, China has seen debates and discussions about the possibility of farming tigers similarly to how crocodiles are farmed. Advocates argue that farming tigers could provide a legal source for traditional medicine and other products, potentially reducing poaching and illegal trade. However, this idea has sparked significant controversy and opposition from conservationists and animal welfare groups.</p>
   
<h3 class="heading_style">Conservation against Tiger Farming</h3>
    <p>Critics point out that farming tigers could exacerbate the problems of illegal wildlife trade and undermine conservation efforts. They argue that such practices could encourage more poaching and trafficking of wild tigers by creating a demand for tiger products, thereby fueling the illegal market. Additionally, concerns are raised about the welfare and ethical treatment of tigers in captivity, as well as the potential impact on wild populations.</p>
